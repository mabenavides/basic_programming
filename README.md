# Programming in R

## Author: Maria Benavides

In this repository, I implemented elemental programming techniques in both contrived and real-world scenarios. I used *for loops* and built *functions*, to to basic math operations. Also, with some World Bank data as input, I built a function to import and tidy a data set. Finally, I did some basic statistical analysis with the data available. 

### Library needed: 

* Tidyverse

### Modified files

* [programming_exercises.Rmd](programming_exercises.Rmd): contains basic programming, using for loops and functions
* [programming_exercises.md](programming_exercises.md): corresponds to the rendered version of the previous file
* [data_world_bank](data_world_bank): folder with the World Bank data sets I used
* [world_bank.md](world_bank.md): contains the code for the function that imports and tidy the data sets
* [programming_exercises.md](programming_exercises.md): corresponds to the rendered version of the previous file
* [world_bank_files](world_bank_files): contains all the graphs I generated
